### Research Question 1: What is the relationship between a song's popularity on TikTok and its performance on the Billboard Hot 100 chart?
TikTok popularity alone does not guarantee mainstream chart success on the Billboard Hot 100, as a substantial portion (64 out of 100) of the most popular TikTok songs failed to chart in the top 50. However, the data also shows that TikTok can be a powerful launching pad for achieving significant chart achievements, with 13 out of the 36 TikTok-viral songs that charted in the top 50 reaching the coveted number one spot.

### Research Question 2: To what extent can a song's popularity on TikTok be predicted using a combination of audio features, and what is the relative importance of each factor in driving popularity?
A song's popularity on TikTok can be predicted to a significant extent using a combination of audio features, particularly loudness, speechiness, and instrumentalness. The findings suggest that vocal-driven, non-instrumental songs with moderate to high loudness levels resonate most strongly with TikTok's user base and are key predictors of popularity on the platform. While energy, tempo, and liveness are identified as moderate factors influencing popularity, the relationship between acousticness and TikTok success remains inconclusive, highlighting the need for further research to fully understand the nuances and interactions between various audio features.

### Research Question 3: What is the relationship between a song's popularity on TikTok and its streaming performance on Spotify or ability to achieve high streaming numbers on Spotify?
There is a disconnect between a song's popularity on TikTok and its ability to achieve substantial streaming numbers on Spotify. While TikTok can catapult songs to virality, with only 26 out of the top 100 TikTok songs securing a spot among Spotify's top 954 most streamed tracks, the majority of TikTok-viral sensations struggle to translate that initial buzz into enduring popularity on music streaming services.
